# #AquariumPuzzle
This is done as an assignment for the Artificial Intelligence course. This notebook includes an Aquarium puzzle, and a comparison of  A* and CSP.  OR-Tools was used in order to be able to create our  cp_model.


## Instructions

The puzzle contains blocks called "aquariums"  and our aim is to fill the aquariums with a specific level of water. The specification of the level are made by the RowConstraints and ColumnConstraints.  An example of this game can be seen in [Aquarium Puzzle](https://www.puzzle-aquarium.com/)

-   Blocks  is a matrix which helps us to visualize the aquarium's state. 
- RowConstraints represents the number of required cells full of water in the rows. 
- ColumnConstraints represents the number of required cells full of water in the columns. 
- inputlength is the number of cells in rows and columns.
